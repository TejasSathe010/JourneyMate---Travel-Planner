    <p>It’s said that all good ideas are born over pizza. JourneyMate was no exception, brought to life on one of our many pizza nights filled with discussions and dreams. The four of us, driven by both a love for travel and a passion for tech, envisioned a way to simplify the planning process for travelers everywhere. So, with slices in hand and ideas flowing, JourneyMate was born—a one-stop travel planner designed to ease your itinerary hassles.</p>
